# Object-Detection-MobileNet-cv
This repo contains script for detecting multiple objects in the given image and return bounding boxes for a given query string.

# Project : 
The following Python script uses MobileNet + SSD for object detection in a given image as it is one of the light weight balanced models with optimum accuracy.

# Getting started :
* We need to install latest version of Opencv.     
[Download here](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)   
* Run the cmd (terminal) :     

* Download the project files using following command in the directory from where you need to run the script :   
```
git clone https://github.com/souravs17031999/Object-Detection-MobileNet-cv   

```   
* Run the command using the following parameters as shown : 
```
python object_detection.py <imagePath> <pathToTextFile> <pathToModel> <confidence_value> <query>
```
